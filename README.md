# COMPSCI — Learning C# and .NET

## Description

This repository is dedicated to learning the fundamentals of programming in C#, with the goal of transitioning into .NET development. Here, I'm building a solid foundation by covering the basics step by step.

## Goals

- Learn the syntax and structure of the C# language  
- Understand core concepts: variables, data types, conditions, loops, methods, and classes  
- Practice building console applications and organizing code using best practices  
- Prepare for working with the .NET platform and advanced technologies like ASP.NET and Entity Framework

## What I've Learned

- Creating and running C# projects using `dotnet`  
- Working with classes, methods, and namespaces  
- Using `for`, `foreach`, `while`, and `do-while` loops  
- Understanding the difference between static and non-static methods  
- Debugging compile-time errors and structuring projects properly  

## What's Next

- Begin exploring the .NET platform  
- Learn file handling, collections, and exception management  
- Start web development with ASP.NET  
- Connect databases using Entity Framework
